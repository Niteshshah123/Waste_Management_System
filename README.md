# Innovative Waste Management System
## Overview
### The Innovative Waste Management System aims to reduce waste in our college environments by encouraging responsible disposal habits. By capturing photos of individuals disposing of waste and recognizing those who frequently engage in proper waste disposal, the system rewards positive behavior and promotes cleanliness.

## Motivation
## Managing waste efficiently in institutions is a critical challenge. This project tackles the issue by combining technology with behavioral incentives, encouraging students and staff to participate actively in maintaining a clean environment.

## Key Features
- Automated Image Capture: Cameras fitted on dustbins capture still images of individuals disposing of waste.
- Facial Recognition: Identifies individuals and tracks the number of disposals.
- Cloud Storage: Images and data are securely stored and processed in the cloud.
- Reward System: Awards individuals who reach a specific disposal count, promoting positive behavior.
- Scalable and Secure: Built on scalable cloud services to handle data efficiently and securely.

A.Technologies Required:

The project uses a combination of hardware, software, and cloud technologies:
1. Hardware Requirements
- Camera: High-definition cameras for still image capture.
- Raspberry Pi: Microcontroller for connecting and controlling the camera.
- Motion or Load Sensor: Triggers the camera to capture images when waste is disposed of.
2. Software Requirements
- Python: Programming language for system control and image processing.
- OpenCV & Dlib: Libraries for image processing and facial recognition.
- Flask/Django: Web frameworks for backend development and data management.
3. Cloud Storage and Processing
- AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure: For scalable cloud storage, serverless processing, and facial recognition.
- AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage / Azure Blob Storage: For storing images.
- AWS Lambda / Google Cloud Functions / Azure Functions: For serverless image processing.
- AWS Rekognition / Google Vision API / Azure Face API: For facial recognition.
- MySQL / Cloud SQL / Azure SQL Database: For tracking user data and disposal counts.
  
B. System Architecture

The system consists of sensors that detect waste disposal, a camera that captures the individualâ€™s photo, and a cloud-based backend that processes images for facial recognition, stores data, and manages the reward system.

C. Data Flow:

- Image Capture: Camera takes a photo when a sensor detects waste disposal.
- Processing: Images are sent to the cloud for facial recognition and data logging.
- Storage: Processed data and images are securely stored in cloud databases.
- Reward System: Users who meet the disposal count are recognized and rewarded.

D. Installation Guide

- Prerequisites: Ensure Python, necessary libraries (OpenCV, Dlib), and cloud SDKs are installed.
- Setup Camera and Sensors: Connect the hardware components to Raspberry Pi.
- Cloud Configuration: Set up cloud storage, databases, and serverless functions.
- Run the Application: Start the main script to begin capturing and processing images.

E.Usage

- Operational Flow: The system runs automatically, capturing images and processing data.
- Viewing Data: Use the backend dashboard (Flask/Django) to view user data, disposal counts, and rewards.
